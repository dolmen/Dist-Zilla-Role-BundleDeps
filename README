NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Role::BundleDeps - Automatically add all plugins in a
    bundle as dependencies

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
        package blahblahblah;
        use Moose;
        ...
        with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle';
        with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::BundleDeps';

    Dependencies appear now for all plugins returned.

DESCRIPTION
    This role attempts to solve the problem of communicating dependencies to
    META.* from bundles in a different way.

    My first attempt was "[Prereqs::Plugins]", which added all values that
    are seen in the "dist.ini" to dependencies.

    However, that was inherently limited, as the ":version" specifier is
    lost before the plugins appear on "$zilla->plugins"

    This Role however, can see any declarations of ":version" your bundle
    advertises, by standing between your "bundle_config" method and
    "Dist::Zilla"
